# Explore US Bikeshare Data

## Description

This script allows the user to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States: 

- Chicago
- New York City
- Washington

In this interactive CLI experience the user chooses one of the three cities. He is then asked if he wants to filter the data by month, day of the week or not at all.  
The following statistics are displayed for the previously made choice: 

- Popular times of travel
- Popular stations and trip
- Trip duration
- Information about the users  

After that the user is asked if he wants to see raw data.  
At the end the user can choose if he wants to restart or quit the script.  

I wrote this script as part of the Data Science Programming for Daimler course.
